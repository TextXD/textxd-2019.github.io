      <description>At the 2017 TextXD event, held at UC Berkeleyâ€™s Institute for Data Science (BIDS), we gathered about 60 researchers from several institutions representing expertise in text analysis. The common bond between all of these researchers coming from different domains is that they work with texts as a primary source of data. Throughout the event, we learned from one another while strengthening ties across disciplinary boundaries and began the development of collaborations that we hope will have a lasting impact on the community.</description>
