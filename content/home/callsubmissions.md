### [Submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtf7W9TqIu-_WIfDvCnYHlrRKVQO899lH6xw4wbBb_Jof-hQ/viewform) an abstract by Sept. 20

TextXD brings together researchers from across a wide range of disciplines, who work with text as a primary source of data. We work to identify common principles, algorithms and tools to advance text-intensive research, and break down the boundaries between domains, to foster exchange and new collaborations among like-minded researchers. We encourage scholars and practitioners from a broad disciplinary and geographic range to apply. <font color = "blue">Talks</font> will range from the theory of text analysis and deep learning to applied analyses or new software packages. 

In addition to presentations, the event will include a <font color = "blue">poster session</font> to create dialogue around NLP projects by students and collaborators. We will send an additional call for posters closer to the event, so please be on the lookout.

TextXD will be held in the Spieker Forum (6th floor) at Chou Hall, Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, on December 3rd to 6th.
